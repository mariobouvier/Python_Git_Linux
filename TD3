EXERCICE 1

# 1. Display the list of files and folders at the root using ls -l
ls -l /

# 2. In a pipeline (using |), append a grep instruction to only display information about bin
ls -l / | grep '^d.*bin'

# 3. Append an awk instruction to only display the size of bin
ls -l / | grep '^d.*bin' | awk '{print $5}'

# 4. Now extract the month, day, and year of creation of the folder bin
# Note: Most Linux systems do not display the creation date using ls -l. Instead, it shows the last modification date.
ls -l / | grep '^d.*bin' | awk '{print $6, $7, $8}'

# 5. The question seems to be incomplete. However, based on the context, I assume you would like to rearrange the instructions to display the name of the folder and its size.
ls -l / | grep '^d.*bin' | awk '{print $9, $5}'

EXERCICE 2

# 1. Run the following command:
curl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cyberattacks > cyberattacks.txt

# 2. Use grep to extract all the lines that contain the keyword "meta":
grep 'meta' cyberattacks.txt

# 3. Now only extract "meta" and the first following word:
grep -o 'meta\(\s[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*\)' cyberattacks.txt

# 4. Only extract the following word (but not the keyword "meta"):
grep -o 'meta\(\s[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*\)' cyberattacks.txt | awk '{print $2}'

# 5. Extract the introduction:
cat cyberattacks.txt | grep -A1 'mw-content-text' | grep -v 'mw-content-text'

# 6. Your turn
# — Extract the tab title
grep -o '<title>.*</title>' cyberattacks.txt

# — Make a list of cyber attacks based on section titles
grep -o '<span class="mw-headline".*<\/span>' cyberattacks.txt
